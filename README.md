# HangMan
A simple HangMan game to play when bored.

The idea behind the game is for the user (you) to think of a word and let the computer attempt to guess what
word you are thinking of. If the computer guesses wrong 6 times the user wins!

To play the game there are two files you will need. The Main and the Words.txt
The words.txt is a type of dictionary thats not too great, but will do the job.
The main is the actual running of the game.

Once you run the game there are instructions on how to proceede with entering words and such.
